Once youâ€™ve done this, you can proceed to follow the [Installation](#installation) and [Database Configuration](#database-configuration) sections to set up and run the project locally.

---

## **Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **Java 21** (as the project uses Java SDK 21)
- **Maven** (to manage project dependencies)
- **MySQL Database** (or another DBMS if configured differently)
- A modern IDE like IntelliJ IDEA for development.

---

## **Installation**

### **Run the Application**
1. Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

2. Run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

## **Database Configuration**

### **1. Database Overview**
The Pickup Scheduling Module uses the following database tables:

| **Table Name**        | **Description**                                   |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `customers`           | Stores customer details, including name, contact, and preferences. |
| `schedules`           | Stores details of scheduled pickups (date, time, location, customer ID). |
| `locations`           | Stores pickup locations and their metadata.       |
| `users`               | Stores authenticated users for the module.        |

You can find the database schema in the `db/schema.sql` file.

---

### **2. Set Up the Database**

1. **Create a Database**:
   Open your database client and create a new database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE pickup_scheduling;
   ```

2. **Run the Schema Script**:
   Execute the script located at `db/schema.sql` to create all necessary tables:
   ```sql
   SOURCE /path/to/db/schema.sql;
   ```

3. **Update Database Credentials**:
   Update the database configurations in `src/main/resources/application.properties`:

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/pickup_scheduling
   spring.datasource.username=<YOUR_USERNAME>
   spring.datasource.password=<YOUR_PASSWORD>
   spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
   ```

---

### **3. Seed Test Data**
Optionally, you can populate the database with initial data using the `db/data.sql` file:
```sql
SOURCE /path/to/db/data.sql;
```
